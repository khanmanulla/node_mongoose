Step 1: Initialize a new Node.js project
initialize a new Node.js project using npm init. This command will guide you through creating a package.json file, which holds various metadata about your project and its dependencies.

npm init

Follow the prompts (you can press enter to accept the defaults for most fields if you're unsure), and this will create a package.json file in project directory.

Step 2: Create index.js file
After initializing the project, create an index.js file in the same directory. This file will contain the code for your Node.js application.

Step 3: Write some code in index.js
Open index.js in a text editor and write a simple Node.js application. For example:

Step 4: Run the Node.js application
node index.js
